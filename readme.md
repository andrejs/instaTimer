# Installation
1. brew install node
2. npm install -g expo-cli
3. expo install react-native-svg
4. expo install react-native-svg-charts
5. git clone https://github.com/andrejs/instaTimer.git

It might ask for CocoaPods and maybe it fails so we need to run
cd ./instaTimer/ios && pod install

# To run do
`expo start` (or just `npm start`)

It will start the Metro Bundler and open it in a browser tab.

# On mobile device
1. Install the "Expo" app
2. Scan QR code from the Metro Bundler
